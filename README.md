# Sketch Gov Icons

Govicons is a collection of open source icons maintained by [540](https://540.co). Each icon is designed on a 24x24 grid with an emphasis on simplicity, consistency and readability. All 125+ icons can be accessed through a library and changed out with ease. Colors can also be changed via `Layer Styles`. Start using Gov Icons in your next design project and feel free to open an issue with any problems you find within the file.

## Getting Started
